# The Things Network: Signal explorer

Quick and simple TTN signal level explorer.

## How to use

Use any TTN node that cycles through different Spreading Factors and use this tool to verify signal levels.

One very useful feature is that it accepts `appeui` and `accesskey` as hash parameters, so you can bookmark direct access to applications, e.g. `https://your-hostname/#appeui=YOUR_APP_EUI&accesskey=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY`.

## Demo

You can access a [demo instance here](https://signal-explorer-wfbfrlaufd.now.sh/).
